# Essentialism

> The Way of the Essentialist involves doing less, but better, so you can make the highest possible contribution. It’s not about getting more done in less time or getting less done. It’s about getting only the right things done. It’s about regaining control of our own choices about where to spend our time and energy instead of giving others implicit permission to choose for us. The first step to essentialism is identifying your values.

## Proposal

1. What problem does your app solve?

- Personal improvement/self-reflection/time management app that helps you prioritize values and reflect on meaningful experiences, improving overall mental health and life quality.

2. Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

- Uncluttered, uncomplicated space to visually prioritize and manage your time better.

3. What is the mission statement?

- An aspiring minimalist? Make the highest possible contribution by taking control of your ability to make choices and funnel your energy into people, places and things that are most meaningful to you. Do less, but better.

## Target Audience

- Anyone who feels overwhelmed or struggles with prioritization. Parents, students, teens, adults.

## Features

- Forms/pages: User Sign up, User Login, Forms for values, profile to show answers/values chosen
- Create an on-boarding process for a new user. React 2/3 - forms, authentication login
- Create a page that shows a list of values (e.g. meditation, family, health, financial, community, environmental). The user will swipe right or left (or otherwise check off) if that value is important to them.
- Create a page that then shows the list of values the person chose (display user card).
- Prompt the user to now choose the top 3 that are the most important to them. Then prompt a user with: In a few sentences, describe why the selected values are important to you. Focus on your thoughts/feelings, and don’t worry about spelling, grammar, or how well-written it is.`
- Integrate a prompt to list all your current projects and things you’re involved in
- Create a page to compare your values to your current projects.
- Using tag system with prompts
